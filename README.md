# COVID-19-death-risk-by-age-and-gender
people ages under 24 are at nearly zero risk of death from COVID (It is death, not infection, infection risk would be higher). Young children are the safest group comparing to other groups. Whereas, the elderly are at the greatest risk of dying, if infected with this virus. Old, male persons are especially at risk of dying of COVID-19.
